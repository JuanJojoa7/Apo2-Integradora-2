# Apo2-Integradora-2

The objective of the work is to develop an application for the online sale of a virtual store in MercadoLibre. The application must allow to enter the inventory of the virtual store and allow the search and elimination of products, as well as register the orders made by the users of the store. It must also have a product finder and an order finder, and it must ensure data persistence using JSON serialization. In addition, the program must handle exceptions to avoid unexpected states during product entry and search. The project must be developed using TDD and the development must be monitored using three quality indicators, including failure density, reliability, and completeness.

NOTE: The indicators and evaluation of the code are found inside the DOC folder, where the analysis of each commit will be with its respective Github link and respective analysis according to the evolution of our program.
